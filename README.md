🎓 Will I Get Placed? – Placement Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a student will get placed or not based on academic and skill-related features using Machine Learning classification techniques. The objective is to analyze student data, identify key factors affecting placement, and build a model that can accurately predict placement outcomes.

This project is part of the Beginner Stage – GDSC AI/ML Inductions Task 1.

🎯 Objectives

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends and patterns.

Build a predictive machine learning model.

Achieve more than 60% accuracy as required.

Understand the factors that influence student placements.

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains student academic and professional details such as:

CGPA

Internships

Number of Projects

Backlogs

Other academic attributes

Target Variable: placed (1 = Placed, 0 = Not Placed)

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The following analyses were performed:

✅ Placement Distribution Analysis

✅ Correlation Heatmap

✅ CGPA vs Placement

✅ Feature Relationship Analysis

📊 Key Insights:

Students with higher CGPA have a higher chance of being placed.

Students with internship experience and more projects are placed more often.

Students with backlogs have lower placement probability.

🧠 Machine Learning Model Used

Algorithm: Logistic Regression

Reason for Choosing:
Logistic Regression is well-suited for binary classification problems like placement prediction (Placed or Not Placed).

⚙️ System Workflow

Load the dataset

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Separate features and target variable

Split data into Training (80%) and Testing (20%)

Train the Logistic Regression model

Test the model on unseen data

Evaluate performance using:

Accuracy Score

Classification Report

Confusion Matrix

✅ Model Performance

Accuracy Achieved: ✅ Above 60% (Requirement Satisfied)

The model successfully predicts the placement outcomes with good reliability.
